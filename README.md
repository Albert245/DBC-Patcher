# DBC Patcher

DBC Patcher is a standalone PyQt5 desktop application for generating and applying domain-specific patches between CAN DBC files. It wraps `cantools` for parsing and provides utilities to maintain a reference database and audit history.

## Features
- Generate JSON patch files by diffing a raw DBC against a cleaned/standardized DBC.
- Apply patches to new raw DBCs while surfacing conflicts, skipped rules, and applied rules.
- Maintain a reference database of canonical messages and signals.
- View audit history and export it to CSV.
- Basic application settings and reusable UI components.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed with `cantools` and `PyQt5` available. Install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install pyqt5 cantools
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python -m dbc_patcher_app.main
   ```

The application will create `data/ref_db.json` and `data/history.json` automatically on first launch.

## Project Layout
```
dbc_patcher_app/
  core/            # Business logic (parser, diffing, patch application, reference DB, history)
  ui/              # PyQt5 interface with tabs and reusable widgets
  data/            # Default locations for reference DB and history log
```

## Notes
- Patches follow a domain-specific JSON schema generated by the diff engine.
